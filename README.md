**Isolated machines for AI coding agents - with active defense.**

COI gives each AI agent its own machine - a full system container with root access, systemd, Docker, and the ability to install anything. Agents work like they would on a real server: run services, manage packages, use cron - without touching your actual system. Files stay correctly owned, no permission hacks needed.

Your credentials stay on the host. SSH keys, environment variables, and Git tokens are never exposed to AI tools unless you explicitly mount them. If something goes wrong, COI catches it - reverse shells, credential scanning, data exfiltration - and pauses or kills the container automatically. No manual intervention needed.

Built by developers, for developers who run AI agents and want to know what those agents are doing. Not a product, not a startup - a tool that does the job.

## Who this is for

- You run AI coding agents and want them to have full machine access - root, Docker, package managers, services - without risking your host
- You want to know when an agent does something suspicious, not find out after the fact
- You run multiple agents in parallel and need them isolated from each other
- You want persistent dev environments that survive restarts and reboots, not throwaway containers that lose your setup every time
- You care about your credentials not ending up inside an agent-controlled environment

## Supported AI Coding Tools

Currently supported:
- **Claude Code** (default) - Anthropic's official CLI tool
- **opencode** - Open-source AI coding agent (https://opencode.ai)
- **pi** - AI coding assistant (https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent)

Coming soon:
- Aider - AI pair programming in your terminal
- Cursor - AI-first code editor
- And more...

**Tool selection:**
```bash
coi shell                    # Uses default tool (Claude Code)
coi shell --tool opencode    # Use opencode instead
coi shell --tool pi          # Use pi instead
```

**Permission mode** - Control whether AI tools run autonomously or ask before each action:
```toml
# ~/.coi/config.toml or .coi/config.toml
[tool]
name = "claude"              # Default AI tool
permission_mode = "bypass"   # "bypass" (default) or "interactive"
```

See the [Supported Tools wiki page](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Supported-Tools) for detailed configuration, API key setup, and adding new tools.

## Features

**Core Capabilities**
- Multi-slot support - Run parallel AI coding sessions for the same workspace with full isolation
- Session resume - Resume conversations with full history and credentials restored (workspace-scoped)
- Persistent containers - Keep containers alive between sessions (installed tools preserved)
- Workspace isolation - Each session mounts your project directory
- Slot isolation - Each parallel slot has its own home directory (files don't leak between slots)
- **Workspace files persist even in ephemeral mode** - Only the container is deleted, your work is always saved
- Container snapshots - Create checkpoints, rollback changes, and branch experiments with full state preservation

**Host Integration**
- SSH agent forwarding - Use git-over-SSH inside containers without copying private keys (`[ssh] forward_agent = true`)
- Environment variable forwarding - Selectively forward host env vars by name (`forward_env` in config)
- Host timezone inheritance - Containers automatically inherit the host's timezone (configurable via `[timezone]` config)
- Sandbox context file - Auto-injected `~/SANDBOX_CONTEXT.md` tells AI tools about their environment (network mode, workspace path, persistence, etc.). Automatically loaded into each tool's native context system: Claude Code via `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, OpenCode via the `instructions` field in `opencode.json`, pi via `~/AGENTS.md` (opt out with `auto_context = false`)

**Security & Isolation**
- Credential protection - SSH keys, `.env` files, Git credentials, and environment variables are **never** exposed unless explicitly mounted
- Privileged container guard - Refuses to start when `security.privileged=true` is detected, which defeats all container isolation
- Security posture verification - `coi health` checks seccomp, AppArmor, and privilege settings to confirm full isolation
- Kernel version enforcement - Warns on host kernels below 5.15 that may lack security features for safe isolation
- Real-time threat detection - Kernel-level nftables monitoring detects reverse shells, C2 connections, data exfiltration, DNS tunneling, and credential scanning
- Automated response - Auto-pause on HIGH threats, auto-kill on CRITICAL — no manual intervention needed
- Network isolation - Firewalld-based restricted/allowlist/open modes block private network access and prevent exfiltration
- Protected paths - `.git/hooks`, `.git/config`, `.husky`, `.vscode` mounted read-only to prevent supply-chain attacks
- Host-side immutable protection - Protected paths are locked with `chattr +i` during sessions, preventing `unshare -m` + `umount` bypass of read-only mounts (opt out: `[security] host_immutable = false`)
- Git identity guard - Containers enforce `user.useConfigOnly=true`, preventing AI tools from committing as the default "code" user
- Guest API disabled - Incus guest API (`/dev/incus`) disabled by default, preventing host path and topology leaks
- System containers - Full OS isolation with unprivileged containers, better than Docker privileged mode
- Automatic UID mapping - No permission hell, files owned correctly
- Audit logging - All security events logged to JSONL for forensics and compliance

**Safe Dangerous Operations**
- AI coding tools often need broad filesystem access or bypass permission checks
- **These operations are safe inside containers** because the "root" is the container root, not your host system
- Containers are ephemeral - any changes are contained and don't affect your host
- This gives AI tools full capabilities while keeping your system protected

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/master/install.sh | bash

# Build image (first time only, ~5-10 minutes)
coi build

# Start coding with your preferred AI tool (defaults to Claude Code)
cd your-project
coi shell

# Or use opencode instead
coi shell --tool opencode

# That's it! Your AI coding assistant is now running in an isolated container with:
# - Your project mounted at /workspace
# - Correct file permissions (no more chown!)
# - Full Docker access inside the container
# - GitHub CLI available for PR/issue management
# - All workspace changes persisted automatically
# - No access to your host SSH keys, env vars, or credentials
```


## Why Incus Instead of Docker or Docker Sandboxes?

Incus is a modern Linux container and virtual machine manager, forked from LXD. Unlike Docker (which uses application containers), Incus provides **system containers** that behave like lightweight VMs with full init systems.

### Security Comparison

| Capability | **code-on-incus** | Docker Sandbox | Bare Metal |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Credential isolation** | Default (never exposed) | Partial | None |
| **Real-time threat detection** | Kernel-level (nftables) | No | No |
| **Reverse shell detection** | Auto-kill | No | No |
| **Data exfiltration alerts** | Auto-pause | No | No |
| **Network isolation** | Firewalld (3 modes) | Basic | No |
| **Protected paths** | Read-only mounts | No | No |
| **Auto response (pause/kill)** | Yes | No | No |
| **Audit logging** | JSONL forensics | No | No |
| **Supply-chain attack prevention** | Git hooks/IDE configs protected | No | No |

### Why Incus Instead of Docker Sandboxes?

- **Linux-first, not Linux-last.** Docker Sandboxes' microVM isolation is only available on macOS and Windows. Linux gets a legacy container-based fallback. COI is built for Linux from the ground up because Incus is Linux-native.

- **No Docker Desktop required.** Docker Sandboxes is a Docker Desktop feature. Docker Desktop is not open source and has commercial licensing requirements for larger organizations. COI depends only on Incus - fully open source, no vendor lock-in, no additional runtime.

- **System containers, not containers-in-VMs.** Incus system containers run a full OS with systemd and native Docker support inside - one clean isolation layer. Docker Sandboxes nests application containers inside microVMs, adding architectural complexity.

- **No permission hell.** Incus automatic UID/GID shifting means files created by agents have correct ownership on the host. No `chown`, no mapping hacks.

- **Credential isolation by default.** Host environment variables, SSH keys, and Git credentials are never exposed to AI tools unless explicitly mounted.

- **Simple and transparent.** No separate daemon, no opaque VM nesting. COI talks directly to Incus - easy to inspect, debug, and extend.

## Installation

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# One-shot install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/master/install.sh | bash

# This will:
# - Download and install coi to /usr/local/bin
# - Check for Incus installation
# - Verify you're in incus-admin group
# - Show next steps
```

**Manual installation:** Download the binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/releases), make it executable, and move to `/usr/local/bin/`. Requires Linux with Incus installed and user in the `incus-admin` group. **You must log out and back in** (or run `newgrp incus-admin`) after adding your user to the group — COI runs `incus` directly and requires the group to be active in your session. See the [Incus installation guide](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/installing/) for setting up Incus.

### Build Images

```bash
# Build the default coi-default image (5-10 minutes)
coi build

# Build without compression (faster iteration)
coi build --compression none

# Build a custom image via a profile
coi profile create my-image --image my-image
# Edit .coi/profiles/my-image/config.toml to add a [container.build] section
coi build --profile my-image
```

**What's included in the `coi-default` image:**
- Ubuntu 22.04 base with Docker (full Docker-in-container support)
- **mise** (polyglot runtime manager) — Python 3, pnpm, TypeScript, tsx pre-installed; add more with `mise use go@latest`, `mise use ruby@3`, etc.
- Node.js 20 LTS (system, for Claude CLI) + npm
- Claude Code CLI (default AI tool) + GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- tmux, git, curl, build-essential, and common build tools
- Modern CLI utilities: fd-find, bat, tree
- Debugging tools: strace, lsof
- Database clients: sqlite3, postgresql-client, redis-tools
- imagemagick for image processing

**Custom images:** Build your own specialized images using profile-based build scripts that run on top of the base `coi-default` image. See the [Image Management wiki page](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Image-Management) for complete profile-based build workflows.

## macOS Support

**COI works on macOS** using [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) or [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) VMs. See the [macOS Setup Guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/macOS-Setup-Guide) for complete instructions.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Interactive session (defaults to Claude Code)
coi shell

# Use a different AI tool
coi shell --tool opencode

# Persistent mode - keep container between sessions
coi shell --persistent

# Use specific slot for parallel sessions
coi shell --slot 2

# Resume previous session
coi shell --resume

# Run a command in an ephemeral container
coi run "npm test"

# Attach to existing session
coi attach

# Real-time security monitoring dashboard
coi monitor

# List active containers and saved sessions
coi list --all

# Gracefully shutdown / force kill containers
coi shutdown coi-abc12345-1
coi kill --all

# Cleanup stopped containers and orphaned resources
coi clean
coi clean --pools             # Detect containers in unused storage pools

# Update coi to the latest release
coi update
```

### Container Aliases

Assign human-friendly names to containers for easy management from any directory:

```toml
# .coi/config.toml (in your project)
[container]
alias = "myproject"
```

```bash
coi shell myproject              # Launch session using alias (from any directory)
coi attach myproject             # Attach to running aliased container
```

See the [Container Lifecycle and Sessions guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Container-Lifecycle-and-Sessions#container-aliases) for full alias documentation.

### Global Flags

```bash
--workspace PATH        # Workspace directory to mount (default: current directory)
--slot NUMBER           # Slot number for parallel sessions (0 = auto-allocate)
--persistent            # Keep container between sessions
--resume [SESSION_ID]   # Resume from session (omit ID to auto-detect latest for workspace)
--continue [SESSION_ID] # Alias for --resume
--profile NAME          # Use named profile
--image NAME            # Use custom image (default: coi-default)
```

Most container customization (network mode, mounts, environment variables, SSH agent, monitoring, timezone, resource limits, etc.) is configured via config files or profiles. See the [Configuration wiki page](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Configuration) for the full reference.

### Advanced Usage

See the wiki for detailed documentation:

- **[Container Operations](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Container-Operations)** - Container management and low-level operations
- **[File Transfer](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/File-Transfer)** - Push/pull files between host and containers
- **[Tmux Automation](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Tmux-Automation)** - Automate AI sessions with tmux commands
- **[Image Management](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Image-Management)** - Create and manage custom images
- **[Snapshot Management](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Snapshot-Management)** - Create checkpoints and rollback changes

## Session Resume

Resume a previous AI coding session with full history and credentials restored:

```bash
coi shell --resume              # Auto-detect latest session for this workspace
coi shell --resume=<session-id> # Resume specific session
coi list --all                  # List available sessions
```

**What's restored:** Full conversation history, tool credentials, user settings, and project context. The profile used when the session was created is also automatically restored — no need to pass `--profile` again (explicitly passing `--profile` overrides the saved one). Sessions are workspace-scoped — `--resume` only finds sessions from the current workspace directory.

See the [Container Lifecycle and Sessions guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Container-Lifecycle-and-Sessions) for details on how session persistence works.

## Persistent Mode

By default, containers are **ephemeral** (deleted on exit). Your **workspace files always persist** regardless of mode.

Enable **persistent mode** to also keep the container and its installed packages:

```bash
coi shell --persistent
```

```toml
# Or via config (~/.coi/config.toml)
[container]
persistent = true
```

**What persists:**
- **Ephemeral mode:** Workspace files + session data (container deleted)
- **Persistent mode:** Workspace files + session data + container state + installed packages, system setup

See the [Container Lifecycle and Sessions guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Container-Lifecycle-and-Sessions) for details.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.coi/config.toml`

```toml
[container]
image = "coi-default"
persistent = true
# storage_pool = ""            # Empty = Incus default pool
# alias = "myproject"          # Human-friendly name for this workspace's containers

[tool]
name = "claude"
permission_mode = "bypass"
# auto_context = true          # Auto-inject sandbox context into tool's native system
```

**Configuration hierarchy** (highest precedence last):
1. Built-in defaults
2. User config (`~/.coi/config.toml`)
3. Project config (`./.coi/config.toml`)
4. `COI_CONFIG` environment variable
5. Environment variables (`CLAUDE_ON_INCUS_*`, `COI_*`)
6. Operational CLI flags (`--workspace`, `--slot`, `--persistent`, `--resume`, `--profile`, `--image`)

Place a `.coi/config.toml` in any repository root to auto-configure COI for that project — useful for teams to share container image, environment, and resource limits.

See the [Configuration wiki page](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Configuration) for the full config reference, per-repo setup, profiles, and environment variables.

## Profiles

Profiles are reusable container configurations bundling image, tool, limits, mounts, build scripts, context files, and environment into named templates. Each profile is a self-contained directory under `profiles/`:

```
.coi/profiles/
├── rust-dev/
│   ├── config.toml      # profile config
│   ├── build.sh         # profile-specific build script
│   └── CONTEXT.md       # AI agent context (appended to sandbox context)
└── python-ml/
    ├── config.toml
    └── setup.sh
```

Example profile config (`.coi/profiles/rust-dev/config.toml`):

```toml
context = "CONTEXT.md"
forward_env = ["CARGO_HOME"]

[container]
image = "coi-rust"
persistent = true

[environment]
RUST_BACKTRACE = "1"

[tool]
name = "claude"
permission_mode = "bypass"

[limits.cpu]
count = "4"
```

```bash
coi shell --profile rust-dev                          # Use a profile
coi profile create rust-dev --image coi-rust           # Create a new profile
coi profile list                                       # List all profiles
```

Profiles support inheritance (`inherits = "parent-name"`), context files for AI-agent instructions, and custom build scripts. See the [Profiles wiki page](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Profiles) for complete documentation.

## Resource and Time Limits

See the [Resource and Time Limits guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Resource-and-Time-Limits) for complete documentation on controlling container resource consumption and runtime.

**Quick example:**
```toml
# ~/.coi/config.toml
[limits.cpu]
count = "2"

[limits.memory]
limit = "2GiB"

[limits.runtime]
max_duration = "2h"
```

**What you can limit:**
- CPU cores and usage percentage
- Memory and swap
- Disk I/O rates
- Maximum runtime and process count
- Auto-stop on time limits


## Container Lifecycle & Session Persistence

See the [Container Lifecycle and Sessions guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Container-Lifecycle-and-Sessions) for detailed explanation of how containers and sessions work.

**Key concepts:**
- **Workspace files**: Always saved (regardless of mode)
- **Session data**: Always saved to `~/.coi/sessions-<tool>/`
- **Ephemeral mode** (default): Container deleted after exit, session preserved
- **Persistent mode** (`--persistent`): Container kept with all installed packages
- **Resume** (`--resume`): Restore AI conversation in fresh/existing container

**Quick reference:**
```bash
coi shell --persistent        # Keep container between sessions
coi shell --resume            # Resume previous conversation
coi attach                    # Reconnect to running container
coi persist                   # Convert ephemeral session to persistent
coi unfreeze <name>           # Unfreeze paused/frozen container
coi unfreeze                  # Unfreeze all frozen COI containers
close                         # Properly stop container (inside, safe alias for poweroff)
coi shutdown <name>           # Graceful stop (outside)
```

## Network Isolation

See the [Network Isolation guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Network-Isolation) for complete documentation on network security and firewalld setup.

**Network modes:**
- **Restricted (default)** - Blocks private networks, allows internet
- **Allowlist** - Only specific domains/IPs allowed
- **Open** - No restrictions (trusted projects only)

```toml
# ~/.coi/config.toml
[network]
mode = "restricted"   # Default — blocks private networks, allows internet
# mode = "allowlist"  # Only specific domains/IPs allowed
# mode = "open"       # No restrictions (trusted projects only)
```

## Security Monitoring

COI includes **built-in security monitoring** to detect and respond to malicious behavior in real-time:

```toml
# Enable in config (~/.coi/config.toml)
[monitoring]
enabled = true
```

**Protects against:**
- **Reverse shells** - Detects common reverse shell patterns (auto-kill)
- **Data exfiltration** - Monitors large workspace reads/writes (auto-pause)
- **Environment scanning** - Flags processes searching for API keys and secrets
- **Network threats (NFT)** - Kernel-level detection of C2 connections, private network access, DNS tunneling, and allowlist violations

**Automated response levels:**
- **INFO/WARNING**: Logged (+ alert for WARNING)
- **HIGH**: Container **paused** (requires `coi unfreeze` to continue)
- **CRITICAL**: Container **killed immediately**

Audit logs are stored at `~/.coi/audit/<container-name>.jsonl` in JSON Lines format.

See the [Security Monitoring wiki page](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Security-Monitoring) for monitoring commands, configuration options, NFT setup, and audit log management.

## Security Best Practices

See the [Security Best Practices guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Security-Best-Practices) for detailed security recommendations.

COI automatically mounts security-sensitive paths as **read-only** to prevent supply-chain attacks:
- `.git/hooks`, `.git/config`, `.husky`, `.vscode`

Set `[git] writable_hooks = true` in config to opt out, or customize protected paths via config. See the wiki for details.

## System Health Check

See the [System Health Check guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/System-Health-Check) for detailed information on diagnostics and what's checked.

**Run diagnostics:**
```bash
coi health                    # Basic health check
coi health --format json      # JSON output
coi health --verbose          # Additional checks
```

**What it checks:** System info, kernel version, Incus setup, permissions, security posture (seccomp/AppArmor), privileged container detection, network configuration, storage, monitoring prerequisites, and running containers.

**Exit codes:** 0 (healthy), 1 (degraded), 2 (unhealthy)

## Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/wiki/Troubleshooting) for common issues and solutions.

**Common issues:**
- **DNS issues during build** - COI automatically fixes systemd-resolved conflicts
- Run `coi health` to diagnose setup problems
- Check the troubleshooting guide for detailed solutions
